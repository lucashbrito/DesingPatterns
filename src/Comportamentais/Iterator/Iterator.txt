Iterator Interface:

IIterator<T> defines the interface for accessing and traversing elements. It includes properties and methods like Current, MoveNext(), and Reset().
Concrete Iterator:

PlaylistIterator implements the IIterator<Song> interface for a playlist. It keeps track of the current position and provides the logic for moving to the next song and resetting the iteration.
Aggregate Interface:

IAggregate<T> defines an interface for creating an iterator. This is implemented by the Playlist class.
Concrete Aggregate:

Playlist maintains a collection of songs and provides a method to add songs to the playlist. It also implements the CreateIterator method to return an instance of PlaylistIterator.
Song Class:

Represents a song with properties for title, artist, and album. It overrides the ToString method to provide a readable representation of the song.
Client:

MusicApp demonstrates the use of the iterator pattern. It creates a playlist, adds songs, and uses the iterator to traverse and print the songs in the playlist.
