The users call our Application then our Application send our Users to Identity Managenment,
IDP (Identity Management) authenticate our user, the ID return for our users an access token (claims). So the user 
apresents the token to our application and our application trust in this token because comes from Identity Management.

Things to consider


The Identity Management will be in Production System so it needs to be available, perfomant and secure. Considerer to work with 
ADFS (provide only basic information like email, ask for more infomation in case for first authentication then the application
will be able to have more information) and Azure Active Directory. The Identity Management should provide Authentication and not Authorization 
returns tokens that contains claims about users like email, name etc..  


The usage of the pattern
 
 Single sing-on. 
 Authentica "external" users. B2B & B2C
 Different tenants, different IDPs. 

 When not to use this pattern 

 When you already have the application using SQL identities to autheticate.

 Federated Identity Example

 Application calls Azure Active directory that has a service with (Identity-as-a-Service, Authtentication, Multi-factor authentication, Advanced threat detection)
